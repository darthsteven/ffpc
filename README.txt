INTRODUCTION
------------
The FileField Podcaster enables Views to generate Podcast feeds using filefield
to store the media files. This module will work with any file that can be
uploaded and managed as a filefield on a node and that can be read by getid3.
Getid3 can read a file and retrieve its metadata (such as runnin time). See
http://getid3.org for more details.

Podcast feeds are those as defined by the specification released by Apple and
available at http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/podcaststechspecs.html.
